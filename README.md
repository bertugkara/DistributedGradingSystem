# DistributedStudentGradingSystem

Today, the number of students in universities is increasing day by day. For this reason, when the academic staff wants to assign homework to students within the scope of the courses, they put an additional burden on themselves and the research assistants. In addition, since universities do not have enough training staff, homework control tasks are left to research assistants. This situation prevents the people assigned to do research from doing their jobs. As a solution, there is a need for a project in which homework control can be transformed into a distributed system.

To solve this problem, it is planned to develop a self-grading system for students. This system called distributed grading, is a project based on grade sharing, where students give grades to each other, used to alleviate the burden of lecturers in classes where the number of students is high for homework checks.

This project aims to create a transparent and fair grading system. Within this project's scope, all students who will take notes are positioned to give grades simultaneously. Thus, it is expected that each student will gain mastery of the subject by examining each assignment within the scope of the course he has graded and that students will establish the most accurate cause-effect relationships on the subject since there is a transparent grading system. This system is intended to encourage participants to be fair and to avoid potential conflicts in grading by providing transparency. On the other hand, in universities where teaching assistants are scarce, it is aimed to reduce the workload of faculty members in grading so that students can perform more diverse and productive assignments, and researchers and academicians can allocate more time to their research, which they cannot carry out due to the increasing homework load.
Within the scope of the project, students will be able to view, comment and score the assignments of the students assigned to them for their grading. In all this interpretation and grading process, the students’ identities will be confidential, and the comments will only be seen by the students whose homework has been commented on.

In this system, there will be an expert besides the students. Although the lecturer who teaches the course is appointed as the expert by default, others may be assigned to this position upon request. The expert will set an amount for each student to check the homework, and students will be able to grade that amount of homework. Students will review the specified amount of homework, which will be randomly assigned to students.
